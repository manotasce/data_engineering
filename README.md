As a data engineer in a team, usually a stack is needed in order
to solve business issues. I created this project to host common
service tier to handle data in hypothetical scenarios.

## Database tier
Contains common sql and nosql databases to support ans scenario.

## Service tier
Intended to develop micro-services, products or other things in regard of 
uses cases.

## Kafka tier
I use this tier to manage publisher/consumer architectures.
